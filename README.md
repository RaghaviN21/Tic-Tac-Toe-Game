**Tic Tac Toe – Two Player Touch Game**

A simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built using Python Tkinter GUI where players can play by clicking on the grid.

  This project is designed for beginners to understand:
      GUI development
      Event handling
      Game logic
      Turn-based interaction

 Project Description:
      Tic Tac Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid.
      
      Player 1 → X
      
      Player 2 → O
      
      Players take turns selecting a box by clicking on it.
      The objective is to place three same symbols in a row:
          ✔ Horizontally
          ✔ Vertically
          ✔ Diagonally
      If all boxes are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a Draw.

  Features:

      ✅ Two-player mode
      ✅ Touch / Click to play
      ✅ Automatic turn switching
      ✅ Winner detection
      ✅ Draw detection
      ✅ Restart game option
      ✅ Simple and user-friendly GUI

 Technologies Used:
      Python
      Tkinter (for GUI)

 How to Run
      In:stall Python (if not installed)
